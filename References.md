As a student we have struggles on creating our own dataset for cars, especially in our country there's a lot of different vehicles if you compare it in the vehicles 
in a free dataset of cars that you can able to download on internet.  our dataset was unable to hit the desired goal so a pre trained model hitting the same goal works fine that's why we choose to use the approach of our reference to make our goal work. We are not owning everything this is just a experience for us student to learn. thesis study rather, that's why I'm uploading this too in github for open source to help others. Thank you. If you have a problem or questions, just use this repository for communication. Thank you again.
